　　菲菲带了自己烘烤的蛋糕到办公室，准备和大家分享。她放下蛋糕，先去冲了杯咖啡，可一转眼，蛋糕不见了！Rob 能解开蛋糕丢失的谜团吗？听他们的对话，学习一个描述物品或人 “消失得无影无踪” 的地道表达。　　　　大家好，欢迎来到 BBC 英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。我是冯菲菲。　　And hello, I’m Rob.　　Rob, would you mind wiping those crumbs from your mouth?　　Oh, sorry!　　Do you know, it’s very strange. I made a cake a last night and brought it into work today to share with you.　　Oh, that’s very kind…　　Yes, but it seems to have vanished into thin air.　　Well, you’re a magician – you’ve made a cake disappear?　　No, Rob. I mean it’s mysteriously and suddenly disappeared. 短语 “vanish into thin air” 的意思是一个物体或人突然神秘地消失得无影无踪，好比烟消云散。You haven’t seen the cake, have you, Rob?　　　Er, no, Feifei – no sign of your ‘disappearing’ cake.　　　　OK, well, let’s hear some examples of this phrase – let’s hope they haven’t suddenly disappeared!　　I can’t remember where I’ve parked the car! I think it’s vanished into thin air.　　Have you seen the boss? Someone important needs to talk to him but I can’t find him anywhere. It’s like he’s vanished into thin air!　　Has anyone seen my glasses? They’ve vanished into thin air!　　这里是 BBC 英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。我们正在教给大家的表达是 “vanish into thin air”。它可以描述一个人或物体突然间神秘地消失得无影无踪。So any sign of my cake?　　Err, no, no.　　Very odd. I put it on my desk this morning and went to make a cup of coffee and when I returned, it had gone.　　　Great cake, Rob! Thanks for sharing it. I hope you’ll be baking again soon! Ha, see ya!　　　　Rob!　　Sorry, Feifei. It was so tempting, so delicious, so I thought…　　　So you thought you’d eat it?　　　Well, it helped us demonstrate today’s phrase.　　　　There’s just one thing I want to vanish into thin air.　　And what’s that?　　You, Rob! Now I’m off to bake a cake - for me.　　　　See ya! Oh, she’s gone.
