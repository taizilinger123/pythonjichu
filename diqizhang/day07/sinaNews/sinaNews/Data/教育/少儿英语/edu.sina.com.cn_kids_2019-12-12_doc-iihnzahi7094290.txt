　　当人们需要描述在过去的某个时间里对未来的预想时，预想结果正确与否并无多大关系，则通常需要使用一般过去将来时。一般过去将来时的基本形式有两种：一、在谈论曾经的意图和对未来的想法时，用 “was/were+going to”；二、在描述曾经对一件事情发生的可能性的判断时，用情态动词 “would+动词原形”。你会用一般过去将来时描述自己曾经有过的计划、打算和想法吗？做八道题，测一测你对这个语法点的掌握程度。　　　　a) will be going to　　b) wasn’t going to　　c) is going to　　d) will　　　　a) would　　b) was going to　　c) will　　d) will have to　　　　a) will not have　　b) won’t　　c) didn’t　　d) wouldn’t　　　　a) will have gone　　b) was going　　c) will be going　　d) will go　　　　a) will　　b) are going to　　c) would　　d) was going to　　　　a) won’t be being　　b) hasn’t been　　c) won’t have been　　d) wouldn’t be　　　　a) I thought we were meeting for lunch today.　　b) I thought we are going to meet for lunch today.　　c) I thought we will have met for lunch today.　　d) I thought we will be going to meet for lunch today.　　　　a) The plane was an hour away from Sydney.
